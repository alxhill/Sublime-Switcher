# Sublime Switcher

Sublime Switcher is a simple theme and color scheme switcher for Sublime Text 2.

It scans your Packages director for any files that end in .tmTheme or .sublime-theme for color schemes or themes respectively. It then presents them to you from a Command Palette option, like this:
